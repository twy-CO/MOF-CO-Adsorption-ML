# MOF-CO-Adsorption-ML
# Machine Learning Analysis of CO Adsorption in MOF Materials

## Project Overview
This repository contains the data and code for our research on carbon monoxide (CO) adsorption in Metal-Organic Framework (MOF) materials using machine learning approaches. The study focuses on analyzing the relationship between structural and physicochemical properties of MOFs and their CO adsorption performance, with a special emphasis on comparing pristine MOFs and transition metal-modified MOFs (TM-MOFs).
